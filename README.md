Car Dealership Console Application

## Description of the Project

is Java console application simulates a car dealership inventory system. It is designed for salespeople or managers at a dealership to help them search for vehicles, add new inventory, or remove sold vehiclesâ€”all from a command-line interface.

The application reads data from a text file and allows the user to:

Search vehicles by price, make/model, year, color, mileage, or type.

View all vehicles.

Add or remove vehicles from the inventory.

It helps small dealerships efficiently manage and update their vehicle listings.

## User Stories

As a salesperson, I want to search by price so that I can offer cars within the customer's budget.

As a manager, I want to add vehicles to inventory so that we can reflect new stock.

As a user, I want to view all vehicles so that I can browse what's available.

As a user, I want to remove a sold vehicle from the system to keep the inventory accurate.
